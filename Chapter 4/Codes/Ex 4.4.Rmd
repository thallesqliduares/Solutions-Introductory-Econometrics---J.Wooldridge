# Exercise 4.4

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

data<-wooldridge::bwght

**In Example 4.9, the restricted version of the model can be estimated using all**
**1,388 observations in the sample. Compute the R-squared from the regression of**
**bwght on cigs, parity, and faminc using all observations. Compare this to the**
**R-squared reported for the restricted model in Example 4.9.**

```{r}
lm1<-lm(bwght~cigs+parity+faminc, data)

summary(lm1)
```
The estimated equation is expressed as follows

$$\widehat{bwght}=114.21-0.47cigs+1.61parity+0.09faminc$$
The R-Squared is equal to 3.4%. Hence, the variability in `bwght` is only 3.4%
explaneid by the exogenous variables of the model.
