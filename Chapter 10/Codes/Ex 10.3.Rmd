**Add the variable `log(prgnp)` to the minimum wage equation in (10.38). Is this variable**
**significant? Interpret the coefficient. How does adding `log(prgnp)` affect the estimated**
**minimum wage effect?**

```{r}


lm1<-lm(lprepop~lmincov+lusgnp+t+lprgnp, data)

summary(lm1)

```

Yes, the coefficient associated to variable `lprgnp` is equal to 0.28 and has 
statistical significance to the 1% level of confidence. So, for an increase
of 1% in `lprgnp` the ` lprepop` increases 0.28%.
